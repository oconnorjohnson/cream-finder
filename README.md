## Description 📃
- Cream Finder is a web-based full-stack application which accepts ice cream truck driver routes and displays locations for ice cream enthusiasts. If you are an ice cream truck driver, you will be able to add your stops so that customers will be able to find you. If you are an ice cream enthusiast then you will be able to look at where they stop.


## Usage  💻 
How does one go about using it?
- [Cream Finder](https://enthousiaste-monsieur-80020.herokuapp.com/) will take you to the deployed site on heroku.
* There will be a list of truck names containing their stops.
* On the nav bar there will be a log in and sign up button. 
* If you have an account then you log in and it will take you to your profile where you can delete your stops or add new stops.
* If you don't have an account then you click the sign up button.
* There will be two options, you either sign up as a business owner or a customer.
* Signing up as a business owner will take you to a page where you can add your stops. 



## Installation 💾
* Git clone the repository onto the user machine.
Run npm init and then npm install where the application was cloned.
